# Resume-Screening-
This project uses NLP and TF-IDF based cosine similarity to match a candidates resume.

Overview:
This project automates the resume screening process by intelligently matching candidate resumes with job descriptions using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning. It addresses the inefficiency of manual resume screening by providing a data-driven approach to rank job opportunities based on relevance.

Key Features:

1.PDF Text Extraction: Extracts text from uploaded resumes using pdfplumber.
2.NLP Preprocessing: Leverages spaCy for advanced text processing (lemmatization, stopword removal, punctuation filtering).
3.TF-IDF Vectorization: Converts text into numerical features to analyze keyword importance.
4.Cosine Similarity: Computes similarity scores between resumes and job descriptions to identify optimal matches.
5.Visualization: Generates a bar chart to compare similarity scores across jobs.

Technologies Used:
Python, pdfplumber, spaCy, NLTK, scikit-learn, pandas, matplotlib.
NLP techniques: Tokenization, lemmatization, TF-IDF, cosine similarity.

Conclusion:
This tool enhances recruitment efficiency by reducing manual effort and providing objective, data-driven recommendations for resume-job alignment.
